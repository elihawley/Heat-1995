Seven years in Folsom.

In the hole for three. McNeil before
that.

NEIL
front
Nod

HANNA
front
McNeil as tough as they say?

NEIL
front
You looking to become a
penologist?

HANNA
front
You looking to go back? You know, I chase
some crews, guys just lookin'
to fuck up, got busted back. That you?

NEIL
side
...
front
You must've worked some dipshit
crews.

HANNA
front
I worked all kinds.

NEIL
side
...
front
You see me doing thrill-seeker
liquor store holdups with a "Born
to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

HANNA
front
No, I do not.

NEIL
front
Right.
side
...
front smile
I am never going back.

HANNA
front
...
front thinking
... 
front tilt
Then don't take down scores.

NEIL
front
I do what I do best. I take
scores. You do what you do best
trying to stop guys like me.

HANNA
side
...
front
So you never wanted a normal-type
life?

NEIL
front smile
What the fuck is that?    Barbecues
and ballgames?

HANNA
front
...
front smile
...
Yeah.

NEIL
side thinking
This regular-type life like your life?

HANNA
front tilt
...
side
My life? No, my life...
front
No, my life's a disaster zone.
side
...because I spend all my time 
front
chasing guys like you around the block.
front smile
That's my life.

NEIL
front
...
side
A guy told me one time: "Don't get yourself
attached to anything you are not willing
to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you
feel the heat around the corner."
front
Now if you're on me and you
gotta move when I move, how do
you expect to keep... a marriage?

HANNA
side
Well, that's an interesting point.
front
What are you, a monk?

NEIL
front
I have a woman.

HANNA
front
What do you tell her?

NEIL
side
...
front
I tell her I'm a salesman.

HANNA
side
So then, if you spot me around the
corner, you're just gonna walk out on
this woman?
front
Not say goodbye?

NEIL
front
That's the discipline.

HANNA
front
That's pretty vacant, no?

NEIL
side
Yeah, it is what it is.
front smile
It's that or we both better 
go do something else, pal.

HANNA
front 
I don't know how to do anything
else.

NEIL
side
...neither do I.

HANNA
side
...
front
I don't much want to either.

NEIL
front
Neither do I.


HANNA + NEIL
front smiles
 
HANNA
side
...
front
You know, we're sitting here, you and I,
like a couple of regular fellows.
You do what you
do. I do what I gotta do. 
side
And now that we've been face to face...
front
If I am there and I got
to put you away, I won't like it.
But, I tell you, if it's
between you and some poor bastard
whose wife you're going to widow, 
brother, you are going down. 

NEIL
front
...
side
...
front
There's a flip side to that coin.
What if you got me boxed in and
I gotta put you down?
Because no matter what, you will
not get in my way.
We've been face to
face, yeah
... 
but I will not hesitate.
Not for a second.

HANNA
side
...
front
Maybe that's the way it'll be.
Or who knows...?

NEIL
side
Or maybe...
front
we'll never see each
other again.

HANNA
front
...

NEIL
front
...

Both smile.
